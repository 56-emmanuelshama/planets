      <h2>What is Neptune?</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a blue ice giant and was discovered in 1846. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea and is similar in structure to Uranus.

      <h2>Color & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune’s deep blue color comes from methane gas in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue. It is known for having the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching up to 2,100 km/h, and enormous storms like the “Great Dark Spot.”

      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has a small rocky core surrounded by a thick mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices. Its outer atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium, along with methane. It is denser than Uranus and has a more active atmosphere.

    <section id="moons">
      <h2>Moons & Rings</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation — a sign it may be a captured object. Neptune also has five faint rings composed mostly of ice and dust.
