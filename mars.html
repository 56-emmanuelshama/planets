      <h2>What is Mars?</h2>
      <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance. It’s one of the most studied planets due to its potential for past life and future human missions.

    <section id="surface">
      <h2>Surface & Terrain</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a rocky, dusty surface with mountains, valleys, and enormous volcanoes. The largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is found here, along with Valles Marineris — a canyon system over 4,000 km long.

    <section id="atmosphere">
      <h2>Atmosphere & Climate</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide. Temperatures are cold, with an average of about -60°C (-80°F), but they can range from -125°C at the poles to 20°C at the equator during summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dust storms are common and can sometimes cover the whole planet for days or weeks.

    <section id="moons">
      <h2>Moons & Features</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos. They may be captured asteroids. Unlike Earth’s Moon, these are much smaller and orbit Mars quickly.
