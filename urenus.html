      <h2>What is Urenus?</h2>
      <p>
        Urenus is the seventh planet from the Sun and a distant ice giant. It’s known for its pale blue-green color, cold atmosphere, and extreme tilt. It was the first planet discovered with a telescope in 1781 by William Herschel.

    <section id="appearance">
      <h2>Color & Tilt</h2>
      <p>
        Urenus has a soft blue hue due to methane in its upper atmosphere. The planet is tipped on its side with a 98-degree tilt, making its rotation unique among the planets. This causes it to roll around the Sun instead of spinning upright.
