      <h2>What is Jupiter?</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth from the Sun. It is a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has been known since ancient times and is named after the king of the Roman gods.

    <section id="appearance">
      <h2>Size & Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is more than 11 times the diameter of Earth and has a powerful presence in the night sky. Its surface appears striped due to strong winds separating bands of clouds. The Great Red Spot, a massive storm system, has raged for centuries.

    <section id="structure">
      <h2>Structure & Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has a dense core possibly surrounded by metallic hydrogen, and a vast outer layer of molecular hydrogen and helium. Its atmosphere is filled with ammonia clouds, lightning, and powerful winds. There are no solid surfaces on the planet.

    <section id="moons">
      <h2>Moons & Rings</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has 95 known moons, including the four largest called the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system. Jupiter also has faint rings made of dust particles.
