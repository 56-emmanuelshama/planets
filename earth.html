      <h2>What is Earth?</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a solid surface, a breathable atmosphere, and liquid water—three essential ingredients for life as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago and has since undergone vast changes through geological activity, evolution, and environmental shifts. It orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days and rotates on its axis every 24 hours.
      </p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
      <h2>Atmosphere & Life</h2>
      <p>
        Earth’s atmosphere is made up mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), which supports life by enabling respiration and shielding us from harmful solar radiation. It also helps regulate the planet’s temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The atmosphere allows weather patterns to form and supports the water cycle. Its balanced composition is vital for plants, animals, and humans to survive.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="water">
      <h2>Water and Land</h2>
      <p>
        About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered in water, with oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes. The remaining 29% is land—made up of continents, islands, mountains, deserts, forests, and plains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Water is essential to life, and Earth is unique among known planets in having stable liquid water. The planet’s surface is dynamic, with tectonic activity shaping its landscape over millions of years.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="climate">
      <h2>Climate & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Earth’s climate varies greatly, from polar cold regions to tropical rainforests. The tilt of its axis causes the seasons. Climate is influenced by oceans, wind currents, solar energy, and human activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weather includes short-term atmospheric conditions like rain, snow, heat, or storms, while climate refers to long-term patterns. Earth’s climate is currently warming due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.
