      <h2>What is Saturn?</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant known for its incredible ring system and yellowish appearance. Named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture, Saturn is both beautiful and mysterious.

    <section id="rings">
      <h2>Rings & Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn's rings are the most extensive and complex in the solar system. They are made mostly of ice particles, with some rock and dust, and stretch out thousands of kilometers, though they’re only a few meters thick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The planet's pale gold color is due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.

    <section id="structure">
      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly hydrogen and helium. It has no solid surface—only layers of gas and liquid. Scientists believe it may have a dense core of rock and metal surrounded by liquid metallic hydrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is less dense than water, meaning it would float in a large enough ocean!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="moons">
      <h2>Moons of Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn has over 140 known moons. The largest, Titan, is bigger than Mercury and has a thick atmosphere with methane lakes. Enceladus, another moon, has geysers that shoot water into space, hinting at a possible underground ocean.

    <section id="facts">
      <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Saturn takes about 29.5 Earth years to orbit the Sun.</li>
        <li>A day on Saturn lasts about 10.7 Earth hours.</li>
        <li>Its rings are divided into 7 groups named A to G.</li>
        <li>Saturn’s gravity compresses it into a flattened shape — it's wider at the equator.</li>
        <li>The Cassini spacecraft studied Saturn for over 13 years before diving into the planet in 2017.</li>
